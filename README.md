Hi! This is an Automation Test for Mobile

Clone this repository with the URL https://github.com/santiago-arenas01/MobileAutomation.git

Use Appium and Android Studio for running the Appium server and the Android emulator

I wrote this code on Intellij. Run in the terminal (after opened the code) the command 'mvn clean install' to be sure you have installed all dependencies you need for running the project

PS: I'm using the jdk22

ðŸš€âœ¨ Click on Run and enjoy the show! âœ¨ðŸš€
